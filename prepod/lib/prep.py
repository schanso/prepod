    Uses the deviation and correlation criterion introduced by
    Bigdely-Shamlo et al. (2015). For the deviation criterion, channels

    correlation criterion, the corr. between a channel and all others is
    calculated in non-overlapping time windows (1 s by default). Within
    each, the maximum absolute correlation is compared to a threshold
